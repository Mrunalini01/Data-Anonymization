# Data Anonymization : 

Protecting individual privacy within gathered datasets is essential in the age of digital prominence and rising data value. Tech companies frequently gather enormous volumes of digital data for a 
variety of uses, such as analytics, system training, and commercial operations. At the same time,research projects want to use these datasets to solve practical issues, however sharing of private
data is restricted due to privacy laws. Analyzing personal data to make it unidentifiable is knownas data anonymization, and it is one way to balance data utility and user privacy. Legislation like
the EU-GDPR, and HIPAA require that personally identifiable information (PII) be appropriately anonymized prior to being made public. GDPR permits the acquisition of data without the need
for express authorization, allowing for its unlimited usage and storage as long as identifiable identifiers are eliminated. The academic world has issues due to inadequate anonymization
techniques and ambiguities in dataset definitions. Cases of supposedly correct data anonymization resulting in privacy violations highlight the necessity of a strong and well recognized
anonymization framework. In order to improve comprehension and application of efficient data anonymization procedures, this research examines established techniques such as k-anonymity, l-
diversity, t-closeness, and differential privacy in addition to state-of-the-art methodologies and industry best practices.

# Objective :

The main objective of this project is to anonymize relational data, with a focus on protecting sensitive information in databases while still considering data utility and regulatory compliance.
• The initial project goal is to categorize traits based on their sensitivity and to develop appropriate anonymization techniques for each.
• The second goal is to analyze the usability of the anonymized data, ensuring that it is still useful for analytical and research purposes.
• Furthermore, the research seeks to investigate the dangers associated with de-identification, so contributing to the general improvement of data privacy and security.
The goal of this research is to strike a balance between data privacy, utility, and ethical data management within the context of relational data anonymization.
